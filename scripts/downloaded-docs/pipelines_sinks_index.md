Sinks define destinations for your data in Cloudflare Pipelines. They support writing to [R2 Data Catalog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/) as Apache Iceberg tables or to [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) as raw JSON or Parquet files.

Sinks provide exactly-once delivery guarantees, ensuring events are never duplicated or dropped. They can be configured to write files frequently for low-latency ingestion or to write larger, less frequent files for better query performance.
