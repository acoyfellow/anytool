A Worker config file may contain configuration for multiple [Cloudflare environments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/environments/). With the Cloudflare Vite plugin, you select a Cloudflare environment at dev or build time by providing the `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` environment variable. Consider the following example Worker config file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "my-worker",
    "compatibility_date": "2025-04-03",
    "main": "./src/index.ts",
    "vars": {
      "MY_VAR": "Top-level var"
    },
    "env": {
      "staging": {
        "vars": {
          "MY_VAR": "Staging var"
        }
      },
      "production": {
        "vars": {
          "MY_VAR": "Production var"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "my-worker"
  compatibility_date = "2025-04-03"
  main = "./src/index.ts"


  vars = { MY_VAR = "Top-level var" }


  [env.staging]
  vars = { MY_VAR = "Staging var" }


  [env.production]
  vars = { MY_VAR = "Production var" }
  ```

If you run `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=production vite build` then the output `wrangler.json` file generated by the build will be a flattened configuration for the 'production' Cloudflare environment, as shown in the following example:

```json
{
  "name": "my-worker",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-04-03",
  "main": "index.js",
  "vars": { "MY_VAR": "Production var" }
}
```

Notice that the value of `MY_VAR` is `Production var`. This flattened configuration combines [top-level only](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#top-level-only-keys), [inheritable](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#inheritable-keys), and [non-inheritable](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#non-inheritable-keys) keys.

Note

The default Vite environment name for a Worker is always the top-level Worker name. This enables you to reference the Worker consistently in your Vite config when using multiple Cloudflare environments. See [Vite Environments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/reference/vite-environments/) for more information.

Cloudflare environments can also be used in development. For example, you could run `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=development vite dev`. It is common to use the default top-level environment as the development environment and then add additional environments as necessary.

Note

Running `vite dev` or `vite build` without providing `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` will use the default top-level Cloudflare environment. As Cloudflare environments are applied at dev and build time, specifying `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` when running `vite preview` or `wrangler deploy` will have no effect.

## Secrets in local development

Warning

Do not use `vars` to store sensitive information in your Worker's Wrangler configuration file. Use secrets instead.

Put secrets for use in local development in either a `.dev.vars` file or a `.env` file, in the same directory as the Wrangler configuration file.

Choose to use either `.dev.vars` or `.env` but not both. If you define a `.dev.vars` file, then values in `.env` files will not be included in the `env` object during local development.

These files should be formatted using the [dotenv](https://hexdocs.pm/dotenvy/dotenv-file-format.html) syntax. For example:

```bash
SECRET_KEY="value"
API_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9"
```

Do not commit secrets to git

The `.dev.vars` and `.env` files should not committed to git. Add `.dev.vars*` and `.env*` to your project's `.gitignore` file.

To set different secrets for each Cloudflare environment, create files named `.dev.vars.<environment-name>` or `.env.<environment-name>`.

When you select a Cloudflare environment in your local development, the corresponding environment-specific file will be loaded ahead of the generic `.dev.vars` (or `.env`) file.

* When using `.dev.vars.<environment-name>` files, all secrets must be defined per environment. If `.dev.vars.<environment-name>` exists then only this will be loaded; the `.dev.vars` file will not be loaded.

* In contrast, all matching `.env` files are loaded and the values are merged. For each variable, the value from the most specific file is used, with the following precedence:

  * `.env.<environment-name>.local` (most specific)
  * `.env.local`
  * `.env.<environment-name>`
  * `.env` (least specific)

Controlling `.env` handling

It is possible to control how `.env` files are loaded in local development by setting environment variables on the process running the tools.

* To disable loading local dev vars from `.env` files without providing a `.dev.vars` file, set the `CLOUDFLARE_LOAD_DEV_VARS_FROM_DOT_ENV` environment variable to `"false"`.
* To include every environment variable defined in your system's process environment as a local development variable, ensure there is no `.dev.vars` and then set the `CLOUDFLARE_INCLUDE_PROCESS_ENV` environment variable to `"true"`.

## Combining Cloudflare environments and Vite modes

You may wish to combine the concepts of [Cloudflare environments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/environments/) and [Vite modes](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#modes). With this approach, the Vite mode can be used to select the Cloudflare environment and a single method can be used to determine environment specific configuration and code. Consider again the previous example:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "my-worker",
    "compatibility_date": "2025-04-03",
    "main": "./src/index.ts",
    "vars": {
      "MY_VAR": "Top-level var"
    },
    "env": {
      "staging": {
        "vars": {
          "MY_VAR": "Staging var"
        }
      },
      "production": {
        "vars": {
          "MY_VAR": "Production var"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # wrangler.toml


  name = "my-worker"
  compatibility_date = "2025-04-03"
  main = "./src/index.ts"


  vars = { MY_VAR = "Top-level var" }


  [env.staging]
  vars = { MY_VAR = "Staging var" }


  [env.production]
  vars = { MY_VAR = "Production var" }
  ```

Next, provide `.env.staging` and `.env.production` files:

```sh
CLOUDFLARE_ENV=staging
```

```sh
CLOUDFLARE_ENV=production
```

By default, `vite build` uses the 'production' Vite mode. Vite will therefore load the `.env.production` file to get the environment variables that are used in the build. Since the `.env.production` file contains `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=production`, the Cloudflare Vite plugin will select the 'production' Cloudflare environment. The value of `MY_VAR` will therefore be `'Production var'`. If you run `vite build --mode staging` then the 'staging' Vite mode will be used and the 'staging' Cloudflare environment will be selected. The value of `MY_VAR` will therefore be `'Staging var'`.

For more information about using `.env` files with Vite, see the [relevant documentation](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode#env-files).
