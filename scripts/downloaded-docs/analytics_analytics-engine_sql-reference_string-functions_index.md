## length

Usage:

```sql
length({string})
```

Returns the length of a string. This function is UTF-8 compatible.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT length('a string') AS s;
SELECT length(blob1) AS s FROM your_dataset;
```

For backwards-compatibility, this function is the equivalent of ClickHouse's `lengthUTF8` function, rather than ClickHouse's `length` function.

## empty

Usage:

```sql
empty({string})
```

Returns a boolean saying whether the string was empty. This computation can also be done as a binary operation: `{string} = ''`.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT empty('a string') AS b;
SELECT empty(blob1) AS b FROM your_dataset;
```

For backwards compatibility, this function can also be called using `empty(<string>)`.

## lower

Usage:

```sql
lower({string})
```

Returns the string converted to lowercase. This function is NOT Unicode compatible - refer to `lowerUTF8` for that.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT lower('STRING TO DOWNCASE') AS s;
SELECT lower(blob1) AS s FROM your_dataset;
```

## lowerUTF8 New

Usage:

```sql
lowerUTF8({string})
```

Returns the string converted to lowercase. This function is Unicode compatible. This may not be perfect for all languages and users with stringent needs, should do the operation in their own code.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT lowerUTF8('STRING TO DOWNCASE') AS s;
SELECT lowerUTF8(blob1) AS s FROM your_dataset;
```

For backwards compatibility, this function can also be called using `toLower({string})`.

## upper

Usage:

```sql
upper({string})
```

Returns the string converted to uppercase. This function is NOT Unicode compatible - refer to `upperUTF8` for that.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT upper('string to uppercase') AS s;
SELECT upper(blob1) AS s FROM your_dataset;
```

## upperUTF8 New

Usage:

```sql
upperUTF8({string})
```

Returns the string converted to uppercase. This function is Unicode compatible. The results may not be perfect for all languages and users with strict needs. These users should do the operation in their own code.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT upperUTF8('string to uppercase') AS s;
SELECT upperUTF8(blob1) AS s FROM your_dataset;
```

For backwards compatibility, this function can also be called using `toUpper({string})`.

## startsWith

Usage:

```sql
startsWith({string}, {string})
```

Returns a boolean of whether the first string has the second string at its start.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT startsWith('prefix ...', 'prefix') AS b;
SELECT startsWith(blob1, 'prefix') AS b FROM your_dataset;
```

## endsWith

Usage:

```sql
endsWith({string}, {string})
```

Returns a boolean of whether the first string contains the second string at its end.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT endsWith('prefix suffix', 'suffix') AS b;
SELECT endsWith(blob1, 'suffix') AS b FROM your_dataset;
```

## position

Usage:

```sql
position({needle:string} IN {haystack:string})
```

Returns the position of one string, `needle`, in another, `haystack`. In SQL, indexes are usually 1-based. That means that position returns `1` if your needle is at the start of the haystack. It only returns `0` if your string is not found.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT position(':' IN 'hello: world') AS p;
SELECT position(':' IN blob1) AS p FROM your_dataset;
```

## substring

Usage:

```sql
substring({string}, {offset:integer}[. {length:integer}])
```

Extracts part of a string, starting at the Unicode code point indicated by the offset and returning the number of code points requested by the length. As previously mentioned, in SQL, indexes are usually 1-based. That means that the offset provided to substring should be at least `1`.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT substring('hello world', 6) AS s;
SELECT substring('hello: world', 1, position(':' IN 'hello: world')-1) AS s;
```

## format

Usage:

```sql
format({string}[, ...])
```

This function supports formatting strings, integers, floats, datetimes, intervals, etc, except `NULL`. The function does not support literal `{` and `}` characters in the format string.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT format('blob1: {}', blob1) AS s FROM dataset;
```

The [formatDateTime](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-reference/date-time-functions/#formatdatetime) function might also be useful.

## extract

Usage:

```sql
extract(<time unit> from <datetime>)
```

`extract` returns an integer number of time units from a datetime. It supports `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE` and `SECOND`.

Examples:

```sql
-- extract the number of seconds from a timestamp (returns 15 in this example)
extract(SECOND from toDateTime('2022-06-06 11:30:15'))
```
