AI Gateway provides a comprehensive set of features to help you build, deploy, and manage AI applications with confidence. From performance optimization to security and observability, these features work together to create a robust AI infrastructure.

## Core Features

### Performance & Cost Optimization

### Caching

Serve identical requests directly from Cloudflare's global cache, reducing latency by up to 90% and significantly cutting costs by avoiding repeated API calls to AI providers.

**Key benefits:**

* Reduced response times for repeated queries
* Lower API costs through cache hits
* Configurable TTL and per-request cache control
* Works across all supported AI providers

[Use Caching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/)

### Rate Limiting

Control application scaling and protect against abuse with flexible rate limiting options. Set limits based on requests per time window with sliding or fixed window techniques.

**Key benefits:**

* Prevent API quota exhaustion
* Control costs and usage patterns
* Configurable per gateway or per request
* Multiple rate limiting techniques available

[Use Rate Limiting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/rate-limiting/)

### Dynamic Routing

Create sophisticated request routing flows without code changes. Route requests based on user segments, geography, content analysis, or A/B testing requirements through a visual interface.

**Key benefits:**

* Visual flow-based configuration
* User-based and geographic routing
* A/B testing and fractional traffic splitting
* Context-aware routing based on request content
* Dynamic rate limiting with automatic fallbacks

[Use Dynamic Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/dynamic-routing/)

### Security & Safety

### Guardrails

Deploy AI applications safely with real-time content moderation. Automatically detect and block harmful content in both user prompts and model responses across all providers.

**Key benefits:**

* Consistent moderation across all AI providers
* Real-time prompt and response evaluation
* Configurable content categories and actions
* Compliance and audit capabilities
* Enhanced user safety and trust

[Use Guardrails](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/guardrails/)

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Protect your organization from inadvertent exposure of sensitive data through AI interactions. Scan prompts and responses for PII, financial data, and other sensitive information.

**Key benefits:**

* Real-time scanning of AI prompts and responses
* Detection of PII, financial, healthcare, and custom data patterns
* Configurable actions: flag or block sensitive content
* Integration with Cloudflare's enterprise DLP solution
* Compliance support for GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS

[Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/dlp/)

### Authentication

Secure your AI Gateway with token-based authentication. Control access to your gateways and protect against unauthorized usage.

**Key benefits:**

* Token-based access control
* Configurable per gateway
* Integration with Cloudflare's security infrastructure
* Audit trail for access attempts

[Use Authentication](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/authentication/)

### Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK)

Securely store and manage AI provider API keys in Cloudflare's encrypted infrastructure. Remove hardcoded keys from your applications while maintaining full control.

**Key benefits:**

* Encrypted key storage at rest and in transit
* Centralized key management across providers
* Easy key rotation without code changes
* Support for 20+ AI providers
* Enhanced security and compliance

[Use Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/bring-your-own-keys/)

### Observability & Analytics

### Analytics

Gain deep insights into your AI application usage with comprehensive analytics. Track requests, tokens, costs, errors, and performance across all providers.

**Key benefits:**

* Real-time usage metrics and trends
* Cost tracking and estimation across providers
* Error monitoring and troubleshooting
* Cache hit rates and performance insights
* GraphQL API for custom dashboards

[Use Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/analytics/)

### Logging

Capture detailed logs of all AI requests and responses for debugging, compliance, and analysis. Configure log retention and export options.

**Key benefits:**

* Complete request/response logging
* Configurable log retention policies
* Export capabilities via Logpush
* Custom metadata support
* Compliance and audit support

[Use Logging](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/)

### Custom Metadata

Enrich your logs and analytics with custom metadata. Tag requests with user IDs, team information, or any custom data for enhanced filtering and analysis.

**Key benefits:**

* Enhanced request tracking and filtering
* User and team-based analytics
* Custom business logic integration
* Improved debugging and troubleshooting

[Use Custom Metadata](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/custom-metadata/)

### Advanced Configuration

### Custom Costs

Override default pricing with your negotiated rates or custom cost models. Apply custom costs at the request level for accurate cost tracking.

**Key benefits:**

* Accurate cost tracking with negotiated rates
* Per-request cost customization
* Better budget planning and forecasting
* Support for enterprise pricing agreements

[Use Custom Costs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/custom-costs/)
