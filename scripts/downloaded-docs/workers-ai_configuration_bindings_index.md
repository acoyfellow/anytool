## Workers

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) provides a serverless execution environment that allows you to create new applications or augment existing ones.

To use Workers AI with Workers, you must create a Workers AI [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/). Bindings allow your Workers to interact with resources, like Workers AI, on the Cloudflare Developer Platform. You create bindings on the Cloudflare dashboard or by updating your [Wrangler file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

To bind Workers AI to your Worker, add the following to the end of your Wrangler file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "ai": {
      "binding": "AI"
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [ai]
  binding = "AI" # i.e. available in your Worker on env.AI
  ```

## Pages Functions

[Pages Functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/) allow you to build full-stack applications with Cloudflare Pages by executing code on the Cloudflare network. Functions are Workers under the hood.

To configure a Workers AI binding in your Pages Function, you must use the Cloudflare dashboard. Refer to [Workers AI bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/#workers-ai) for instructions.

## Methods

### async env.AI.run()

`async env.AI.run()` runs a model. Takes a model as the first parameter, and an object as the second parameter.

```javascript
const answer = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {
    prompt: "What is the origin of the phrase 'Hello, World'"
});
```

**Parameters**

* `model` string required

  * The model to run.

  **Supported options**

  * `stream` boolean optional
    * Returns a stream of results as they are available.

```javascript
const answer = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {
    prompt: "What is the origin of the phrase 'Hello, World'",
    stream: true
});


return new Response(answer, {
    headers: { "content-type": "text/event-stream" }
});
```
