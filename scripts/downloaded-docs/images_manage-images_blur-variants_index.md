You can apply blur to image variants by creating a specific variant for this effect first or by editing a previously created variant. Note that you cannot blur an SVG file.

Refer to [Resize images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/manage-images/create-variants/) for help creating variants. You can also refer to the API to learn how to use blur using flexible variants.

To blur an image:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, got to the **Variants** page.

   [Go to **Variants**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/images/variants)

2. Find the variant you want to blur and select **Edit** > **Customization Options**.

3. Use the slider to adjust the blurring effect. You can use the preview image to see how strong the blurring effect will be.

4. Select **Save**.

The image should now display the blurred effect.
