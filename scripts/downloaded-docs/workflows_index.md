Build durable multi-step applications on Cloudflare Workers with Workflows.

Available on Free and Paid plans

With Workflows, you can build applications that chain together multiple steps, automatically retry failed tasks, and persist state for minutes, hours, or even weeks - with no infrastructure to manage.

Workflows give you:

* Reliable multi-step operations without worrying about timeouts
* Automatic retries and error handling
* Built-in observability for long running operations
* Simple and expressive code for complex processes

- Workflow Code

  ```ts
  export class CheckoutWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
    async run (event, step) {
      const processorResponse = await step.do( 'submit payment', async () => {
        let resp = await submitToPaymentProcessor(event.params.payment) ;
        return await resp.json<any>();
      }) ;


      const textResponse = await step.do( 'send confirmation text', sendConfirmation);
      await step.sleep('wait for feedback', '2 days');
      await step.do('send feedback email', sendFeedbackEmail);
      await step.sleep('delay before marketing', '30 days');
      await step.do( 'send marketing follow up', sendFollowUp);
    }
  }
  ```

- Workflow Config

  ```json
  {
    "name": "my-worker-with-workflow",
    "main": "src/index.js",
    "compatibility_date": "2025-02-27",
    "workflows": [
      {
        "name": "checkout-workflow",
        "binding": "CHECKOUT",
        "class_name": "CheckoutWorkflow"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
