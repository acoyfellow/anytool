AI Gateway supports a variety of headers to help you configure, customize, and manage your API requests. This page provides a complete list of all supported headers, along with a short description

| Term | Definition |
| - | - |
| cf-aig-backoff | Header to customize the backoff type for [request retries](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling/#request-retries) of a request. |
| cf-aig-cache-key | The [cf-aig-cache-key-aig-cache-key](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/#custom-cache-key-cf-aig-cache-key) let you override the default cache key in order to precisely set the cacheability setting for any resource. |
| cf-aig-cache-status | [Status indicator for caching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/#default-configuration), showing if a request was served from cache. |
| cf-aig-cache-ttl | Specifies the [cache time-to-live for responses](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/#cache-ttl-cf-aig-cache-ttl). |
| cf-aig-collect-log | The [cf-aig-collect-log](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/#collect-logs-cf-aig-collect-log) header allows you to bypass the default log setting for the gateway. |
| cf-aig-custom-cost | Allows the [customization of request cost](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/custom-costs/#custom-cost) to reflect user-defined parameters. |
| cf-aig-event-id | [cf-aig-event-id](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/evaluations/add-human-feedback-api/#3-retrieve-the-cf-aig-log-id) is a unique identifier for an event, used to trace specific events through the system. |
| cf-aig-log-id | The [cf-aig-log-id](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/evaluations/add-human-feedback-api/#3-retrieve-the-cf-aig-log-id) is a unique identifier for the specific log entry to which you want to add feedback. |
| cf-aig-max-attempts | Header to customize the number of max attempts for [request retries](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling/#request-retries) of a request. |
| cf-aig-metadata | [Custom metadata](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/custom-metadata/)allows you to tag requests with user IDs or other identifiers, enabling better tracking and analysis of your requests. |
| cf-aig-request-timeout | Header to trigger a fallback provider based on a [predetermined response time](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/fallbacks/#request-timeouts) (measured in milliseconds). |
| cf-aig-retry-delay | Header to customize the retry delay for [request retries](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling/#request-retries) of a request. |
| cf-aig-skip-cache | Header to [bypass caching for a specific request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/caching/#skip-cache-cf-aig-skip-cache). |
| cf-aig-step | [cf-aig-step](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/fallbacks/#response-headercf-aig-step) identifies the processing step in the AI Gateway flow for better tracking and debugging. |
| cf-cache-ttl | Deprecated: This header is replaced by `cf-aig-cache-ttl`. It specifies cache time-to-live. |
| cf-skip-cache | Deprecated: This header is replaced by `cf-aig-skip-cache`. It bypasses caching for a specific request. |

## Configuration hierarchy

Settings in AI Gateway can be configured at three levels: **Provider**, **Request**, and **Gateway**. Since the same settings can be configured in multiple locations, the following hierarchy determines which value is applied:

1. **Provider-level headers**: Relevant only when using the [Universal Endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/universal/), these headers take precedence over all other configurations.
2. **Request-level headers**: Apply if no provider-level headers are set.
3. **Gateway-level settings**: Act as the default if no headers are set at the provider or request levels.

This hierarchy ensures consistent behavior, prioritizing the most specific configurations. Use provider-level and request-level headers for more fine-tuned control, and gateway settings for general defaults.
