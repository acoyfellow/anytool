To enable Cloudflare for SaaS for your account:

1. Log into the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).

2. Select your account and zone.

3. Go to **SSL/TLS** > **Custom Hostnames**.

4. Select **Enable**.

5. The next step depends on the zone's plan:

   * **Enterprise**: Can preview this product as a [non-contract service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/billing/preview-services/), which provide full access, free of metered usage fees, limits, and certain other restrictions.
   * **Non-enterprise**: Will have to enter payment information.

Note

Different zone plan levels have access to different features. For more details, refer to [Plans](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/plans/).
