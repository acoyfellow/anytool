[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. A core principle of Vue is incremental adoption: this makes it easy to build Vue applications that live side-by-side with your existing code.

In this guide, you will create a new Vue application and deploy it using Cloudflare Pages. You will use `vue-cli`, a batteries-included tool for generating new Vue applications.

## Setting up a new project

Use the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) CLI (C3) to set up a new project. C3 will create a new project directory, initiate Vue's official setup tool, and provide the option to deploy instantly.

To use `create-cloudflare` to create a new Vue project, run the following command:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-vue-app --framework=vue --platform=pages
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare my-vue-app --framework=vue --platform=pages
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest my-vue-app --framework=vue --platform=pages
  ```

## Before you continue

All of the framework guides assume you already have a fundamental understanding of [Git](https://git-scm.com/). If you are new to Git, refer to this [summarized Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) on how to set up Git on your local machine.

If you clone with SSH, you must [generate SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub.

Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) and [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for more information.

## Create a GitHub repository

Create a new GitHub repository by visiting [repo.new](https://repo.new). After creating a new repository, go to your newly created project directory to prepare and push your local application to GitHub by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-gh-username>/<repository-name>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

### Deploy via the `create-cloudflare` CLI (C3)

If you use [`create-cloudflare`(C3)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) to create your new Vue project, C3 will install all dependencies needed for your project and prompt you to deploy your project via the CLI. If you deploy, your site will be live and you will be provided with a deployment URL.

### Deploy via the Cloudflare dashboard

## Learn more

By completing this guide, you have successfully deployed your site to Cloudflare Pages. To get started with other frameworks, [refer to the list of Framework guides](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/).

| Configuration option | Value |
| - | - |
| Production branch | `main` |
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Build directory | `dist` |

After configuring your site, you can begin your first deploy. You should see Cloudflare Pages installing `vue`, your project dependencies, and building your site, before deploying it.

Note

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/).

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`. Every time you commit new code to your Vue application, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests, so you can preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.
