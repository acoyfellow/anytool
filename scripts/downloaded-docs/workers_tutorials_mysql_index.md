In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Cloudflare Workers application and connect it to a MySQL database using [TCP Sockets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/) and [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/). The Workers application you create in this tutorial will interact with a product database inside of MySQL.

Note

We recommend using [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/) to connect to your MySQL database. Hyperdrive provides optimal performance and will ensure secure connectivity between your Worker and your MySQL database.

When connecting directly to your MySQL database (without Hyperdrive), the MySQL drivers rely on unsupported Node.js APIs to create secure connections, which prevents connections.

## Prerequisites

To continue:

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages) if you have not already.
2. Install [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started).
3. Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/). Use a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.
4. Make sure you have access to a MySQL database.

## 1. Create a Worker application

First, use the [`create-cloudflare` CLI](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare) to create a new Worker application. To do this, open a terminal window and run the following command:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- mysql-tutorial
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare mysql-tutorial
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest mysql-tutorial
  ```

This will prompt you to install the [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) package and lead you through a setup wizard.

For setup, select the following options:

* For *What would you like to start with?*, choose `Hello World example`.
* For *Which template would you like to use?*, choose `Worker only`.
* For *Which language do you want to use?*, choose `TypeScript`.
* For *Do you want to use git for version control?*, choose `Yes`.
* For *Do you want to deploy your application?*, choose `No` (we will be making some changes before deploying).

If you choose to deploy, you will be asked to authenticate (if not logged in already), and your project will be deployed. If you deploy, you can still modify your Worker code and deploy again at the end of this tutorial.

Now, move into the newly created directory:

```sh
cd mysql-tutorial
```

## 2. Enable Node.js compatibility

[Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) is required for database drivers, including mysql2, and needs to be configured for your Workers project.

To enable both built-in runtime APIs and polyfills for your Worker or Pages project, add the [`nodejs_compat`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag) [compatibility flag](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag) to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/), and set your compatibility date to September 23rd, 2024 or later. This will enable [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) for your Workers project.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23"
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"
  ```

## 3. Create a Hyperdrive configuration

Create a Hyperdrive configuration using the connection string for your MySQL database.

```bash
npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="mysql://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
```

This command outputs the Hyperdrive configuration `id` that will be used for your Hyperdrive [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/). Set up your binding by specifying the `id` in the Wrangler file.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "hyperdrive-example"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


  # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

## 4. Query your database from your Worker

Install the [mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add mysql2@>3.13.0
  ```

Note

`mysql2` v3.13.0 or later is required

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `connection` instance and pass the Hyperdrive parameters:

```ts
// mysql2 v3.13.0 or later is required
import { createConnection } from "mysql2/promise";


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a connection using the mysql2 driver with the Hyperdrive credentials (only accessible from your Worker).
    const connection = await createConnection({
      host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
      user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
      password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
      database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
      port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port,


      // Required to enable mysql2 compatibility for Workers
      disableEval: true,
    });


    try {
      // Sample query
      const [results, fields] = await connection.query("SHOW tables;");


      // Clean up the client after the response is returned, before the Worker is killed
      ctx.waitUntil(connection.end());


      // Return result rows as JSON
      return Response.json({ results, fields });
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Note

The minimum version of `mysql2` required for Hyperdrive is `3.13.0`.

## 5. Deploy your Worker

Run the following command to deploy your Worker:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

Your application is now live and accessible at `<YOUR_WORKER>.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`.
