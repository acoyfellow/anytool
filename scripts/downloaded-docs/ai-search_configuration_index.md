You can customize how your AI Search instance indexes your data, and retrieves and generates responses for queries. Some settings can be updated after the instance is created, while others are fixed at creation time.

The table below lists all available configuration options:

| [Chunk overlap](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/chunking/) | yes | Number of overlapping tokens between chunks |
| [Embedding model](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/models/) | no | Model used to generate vector embeddings |
| [Query rewrite](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/query-rewriting/) | yes | Enable or disable query rewriting before retrieval |
| [Query rewrite model](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/models/) | yes | Model used for query rewriting |

API token

The Service API token is different from the AI Search API token that you can make to interact with your AI Search. The Service API token is only used by AI Search to get permissions to configure resources on your account.
