[Audit logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/account-security/review-audit-logs/) provide a comprehensive summary of changes made within your Cloudflare account, including those made to R2 buckets. This functionality is available on all plan types, free of charge, and is always enabled.

## Viewing audit logs

To view audit logs for your R2 buckets, go to the **Audit logs** page.

[Go to **Audit logs**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/audit-log)

For more information on how to access and use audit logs, refer to [Review audit logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/account-security/review-audit-logs/).

The following configuration actions are logged:

| Operation | Description |

Logs for data access operations, such as `GetObject` and `PutObject`, are not included in audit logs. To log HTTP requests made to public R2 buckets, use the [HTTP requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/http_requests/) Logpush dataset.
