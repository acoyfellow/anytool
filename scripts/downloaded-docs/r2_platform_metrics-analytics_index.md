R2 exposes analytics that allow you to inspect the requests and storage of the buckets in your account.

The metrics displayed for a bucket in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) are queried from Cloudflare's [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/). You can access the metrics [programmatically](#query-via-the-graphql-api) via GraphQL or HTTP client.

## Metrics

R2 currently has two datasets:

| Dataset | GraphQL Dataset Name | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Operations | `r2OperationsAdaptiveGroups` | This dataset consists of the operations taken on a bucket within an account. |
| Storage | `r2StorageAdaptiveGroups` | This dataset consists of the storage of a bucket within an account. |

### Operations Dataset

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| actionType | The name of the operation performed. |
| actionStatus | The status of the operation. Can be `success`, `userError`, or `internalError`. |
| bucketName | The bucket this operation was performed on if applicable. For buckets with a jurisdiction specified, you must include the jurisdiction followed by an underscore before the bucket name. For example: `eu_your-bucket-name` |
| objectName | The object this operation was performed on if applicable. |
| responseStatusCode | The http status code returned by this operation. |
| datetime | The time of the request. |

### Storage Dataset

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| bucketName | The bucket this storage value is for. For buckets with a jurisdiction specified, you must include the [jurisdiction](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/reference/data-location/#jurisdictional-restrictions) followed by an underscore before the bucket name. For example: `eu_your-bucket-name` |
| payloadSize | The size of the objects in the bucket. |
| metadataSize | The size of the metadata of the objects in the bucket. |
| objectCount | The number of objects in the bucket. |
| uploadCount | The number of pending multipart uploads in the bucket. |
| datetime | The time that this storage value represents. |

Metrics can be queried (and are retained) for the past 31 days. These datasets require an `accountTag` filter with your Cloudflare account ID.

Querying buckets with jurisdiction restriction

In you account, you may have two buckets of the same name, one with a specified jurisdiction, and one without.

Therefore, if you want to query metrics about a bucket which has a specified jurisdiction, you must include the [jurisdiction](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/reference/data-location/#jurisdictional-restrictions) followed by an underscore before the bucket name. For example: `eu_bucket-name`. This ensures you query the correct bucket.

## View via the dashboard

Per-bucket analytics for R2 are available in the Cloudflare dashboard. To view current and historical metrics for a bucket:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **R2 object storage** page.

   [Go to **Overview**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/overview)

2. Select your bucket.

3. Select the **Metrics** tab.

You can optionally select a time window to query. This defaults to the last 24 hours.

## Query via the GraphQL API

You can programmatically query analytics for your R2 buckets via the [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/). This API queries the same dataset as the Cloudflare dashboard, and supports GraphQL [introspection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/features/discovery/introspection/).

## Examples

### Operations

To query the volume of each operation type on a bucket for a given time period you can run a query as such

```graphql
query R2VolumeExample(
  $accountTag: string!
  $startDate: Time
  $endDate: Time
  $bucketName: string
) {
  viewer {
    accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {
      r2OperationsAdaptiveGroups(
        limit: 10000
        filter: {
          datetime_geq: $startDate
          datetime_leq: $endDate
          bucketName: $bucketName
        }
      ) {
        sum {
          requests
        }
        dimensions {
          actionType
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `bucketName` field can be removed to get an account level overview of operations. The volume of operations can be broken down even further by adding more dimensions to the query.

### Storage

To query the storage of a bucket over a given time period you can run a query as such.

```graphql
query R2StorageExample(
  $accountTag: string!
  $startDate: Time
  $endDate: Time
  $bucketName: string
) {
  viewer {
    accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {
      r2StorageAdaptiveGroups(
        limit: 10000
        filter: {
          datetime_geq: $startDate
          datetime_leq: $endDate
          bucketName: $bucketName
        }
        orderBy: [datetime_DESC]
      ) {
        max {
          objectCount
          uploadCount
          payloadSize
          metadataSize
        }
        dimensions {
          datetime
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
