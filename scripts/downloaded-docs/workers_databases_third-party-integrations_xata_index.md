[Xata](https://xata.io) is a PostgreSQL database platform designed to help developers operate and scale databases with enhanced productivity and performance. Xata provides features like instant copy-on-write database branches, zero-downtime schema changes, data anonymization, AI-powered performance monitoring, and BYOC.

Note

You can connect to Xata using [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive), which provides connection pooling and reduces the amount of round trips required to create a secure connection from Workers to your database.

Hyperdrive can provide lower latencies because it performs the database connection setup and connection pooling across Cloudflare's network. Hyperdrive supports native database drivers, libraries, and ORMs, and is included in all [Workers plans](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/platform/pricing/). Learn more about Hyperdrive in [How Hyperdrive Works](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/how-hyperdrive-works/).

Refer to the full [Xata documentation](https://xata.io/documentation).

To connect to Xata using [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive), follow these steps:

## 1. Allow Hyperdrive access

You can connect Hyperdrive to any existing Xata PostgreSQL database with the connection string provided by Xata.

### Xata dashboard

To retrieve your connection string from the Xata dashboard:

1. Go to the [**Xata dashboard**](https://xata.io/).
2. Select the database you want to connect to.
3. Copy the `PostgreSQL` connection string.

Refer to the full [Xata documentation](https://xata.io/documentation).

## 2. Create a database configuration

To configure Hyperdrive, you will need:

* The IP address (or hostname) and port of your database.
* The database username (for example, `hyperdrive-demo`) you configured in a previous step.
* The password associated with that username.
* The name of the database you want Hyperdrive to connect to. For example, `postgres`.

Hyperdrive accepts the combination of these parameters in the common connection string format used by database drivers:

```txt
postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name
```

Most database providers will provide a connection string you can directly copy-and-paste directly into Hyperdrive.

* Dashboard

  To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the Cloudflare dashboard:

  1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Hyperdrive** page.

     [Go to **Hyperdrive**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/hyperdrive)

  2. Select **Create Configuration**.

  3. Fill out the form, including the connection string.

  4. Select **Create**.

* Wrangler CLI

  To create a Hyperdrive configuration with the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/):

  1. Open your terminal and run the following command. Replace `<NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG>` with a name for your Hyperdrive configuration and paste the connection string provided from your database host, or replace `user`, `password`, `HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS`, `port`, and `database_name` placeholders with those specific to your database:

     ```sh
     npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"
     ```

  2. This command outputs a binding for the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

     * wrangler.jsonc

       ```jsonc
       {
         "name": "hyperdrive-example",
         "main": "src/index.ts",
         "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
         "compatibility_flags": [
           "nodejs_compat"
         ],
         "hyperdrive": [
           {
             "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
             "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
           }
         ]
       }
       ```

     * wrangler.toml

       ```toml
       name = "hyperdrive-example"
       main = "src/index.ts"
       compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
       compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


       # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
       [[hyperdrive]]
       binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
       id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
       ```

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "hyperdrive-example",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2024-08-21",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "hyperdrive-example"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2024-08-21"
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]


  # Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
  ```

Note

Hyperdrive will attempt to connect to your database with the provided credentials to verify they are correct before creating a configuration. If you encounter an error when attempting to connect, refer to Hyperdrive's [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/observability/troubleshooting/) to debug possible causes.

## 3. Use Hyperdrive from your Worker

Install the `node-postgres` driver:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add pg@>8.16.3
  ```

Note

The minimum version of `node-postgres` required for Hyperdrive is `8.16.3`.

If using TypeScript, install the types package:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i -D @types/pg
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add -D @types/pg
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add -D @types/pg
  ```

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",
    "hyperdrive": [
      {
        "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
        "id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # required for database drivers to function
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"


  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
  ```

Create a new `Client` instance and pass the Hyperdrive `connectionString`:

```ts
// filepath: src/index.ts
import { Client } from "pg";


export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    ctx: ExecutionContext,
  ): Promise<Response> {
    // Create a new client instance for each request.
    const client = new Client({
      connectionString: env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString,
    });


    try {
      // Connect to the database
      await client.connect();
      console.log("Connected to PostgreSQL database");


      // Perform a simple query
      const result = await client.query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables");


      return Response.json({
        success: true,
        result: result.rows,
      });
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error("Database error:", error.message);


      new Response("Internal error occurred", { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

Note

If you expect to be making multiple parallel database queries within a single Worker invocation, consider using a [connection pool (`pg.Pool`)](https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool) to allow for parallel queries. If doing so, set the max connections of the connection pool to 5 connections. This ensures that the connection pool fits within [Workers' concurrent open connections limit of 6](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits), which affect TCP connections that database drivers use.
