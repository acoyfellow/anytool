You can bind and trigger Workflows from [Pages Functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/) by deploying a Workers project with your Workflow definition and then invoking that Worker using [service bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/#service-bindings) or a standard `fetch()` call.

Note

You will need to deploy your Workflow as a standalone Workers project first before your Pages Function can call it. If you have not yet deployed a Workflow, refer to the Workflows [get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/get-started/guide/).

### Use Service Bindings

[Service Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/) allow you to call a Worker from another Worker or a Pages Function without needing to expose it directly.

To do this, you will need to:

1. Deploy your Workflow in a Worker
2. Create a Service Binding to that Worker in your Pages project
3. Call the Worker remotely using the binding

For example, if you have a Worker called `workflows-starter`, you would create a new Service Binding in your Pages project as follows, ensuring that the `service` name matches the name of the Worker your Workflow is defined in:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "services": [
      {
        "binding": "WORKFLOW_SERVICE",
        "service": "workflows-starter"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  services = [
    { binding = "WORKFLOW_SERVICE", service = "workflows-starter" }
  ]
  ```

Your Worker can expose a specific method (or methods) that only other Workers or Pages Functions can call over the Service Binding.

In the following example, we expose a specific `createInstance` method that accepts our `Payload` and returns the [`InstanceStatus`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#instancestatus) from the Workflows API:

* JavaScript

  ```js
  import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";


  export default class WorkflowsService extends WorkerEntrypoint {
    // Currently, entrypoints without a named handler are not supported
    async fetch() {
      return new Response(null, { status: 404 });
    }


    async createInstance(payload) {
      let instance = await this.env.MY_WORKFLOW.create({
        params: payload,
      });


      return Response.json({
        id: instance.id,
        details: await instance.status(),
      });
    }
  }
  ```

* TypeScript

  ```ts
  import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";


  interface Env {
    MY_WORKFLOW: Workflow;
  }


  type Payload = {
    hello: string;
  }


  export default class WorkflowsService extends WorkerEntrypoint<Env> {
    // Currently, entrypoints without a named handler are not supported
    async fetch() { return new Response(null, {status: 404}); }


    async createInstance(payload: Payload) {
      let instance = await this.env.MY_WORKFLOW.create({
        params: payload
      });


      return Response.json({
        id: instance.id,
        details: await instance.status(),
      });
    }
  }
  ```

Your Pages Function would resemble the following:

* JavaScript

  ```js
  export const onRequest = async (context) => {
    // This payload could be anything from within your app or from your frontend
    let payload = { hello: "world" };
    return context.env.WORKFLOWS_SERVICE.createInstance(payload);
  };
  ```

* TypeScript

  ```ts
  interface Env {
    WORKFLOW_SERVICE: Service;
  }


  export const onRequest: PagesFunction<Env> = async (context) => {
    // This payload could be anything from within your app or from your frontend
    let payload = {"hello": "world"}
    return context.env.WORKFLOWS_SERVICE.createInstance(payload)
  };
  ```

To learn more about binding to resources from Pages Functions, including how to bind via the Cloudflare dashboard, refer to the [bindings documentation for Pages Functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/#service-bindings).

### Using fetch

Service Bindings vs. fetch

We recommend using [Service Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/) when calling a Worker in your own account.

Service Bindings don't require you to expose a public endpoint from your Worker, don't require you to configure authentication, and allow you to call methods on your Worker directly, avoiding the overhead of managing HTTP requests and responses.

An alternative to setting up a Service Binding is to call the Worker over HTTP by using the Workflows [Workers API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflow) to `create` a new Workflow instance for each incoming HTTP call to the Worker:

* JavaScript

  ```js
  // This is in the same file as your Workflow definition
  export default {
    async fetch(req, env) {
      let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create({
        params: payload,
      });
      return Response.json({
        id: instance.id,
        details: await instance.status(),
      });
    },
  };
  ```

* TypeScript

  ```ts
  // This is in the same file as your Workflow definition
  export default {
    async fetch(req: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
      let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create({
        params: payload
      });
      return Response.json({
        id: instance.id,
        details: await instance.status(),
      });
    },
  };
  ```

Your [Pages Function](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/get-started/) can then make a regular `fetch` call to the Worker:

* JavaScript

  ```js
  export const onRequest = async (context) => {
    // Other code
    let payload = { hello: "world" };
    const instanceStatus = await fetch("https://YOUR_WORKER.workers.dev/", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(payload), // Send a payload for our Worker to pass to the Workflow
    });


    return Response.json(instanceStatus);
  };
  ```

* TypeScript

  ```ts
  export const onRequest: PagesFunction<Env> = async (context) => {
    // Other code
    let payload = {"hello": "world"}
    const instanceStatus = await fetch("https://YOUR_WORKER.workers.dev/", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(payload) // Send a payload for our Worker to pass to the Workflow
    })


    return Response.json(instanceStatus);
  };
  ```

You can also choose to authenticate these requests by passing a shared secret in a header and validating that in your Worker.
