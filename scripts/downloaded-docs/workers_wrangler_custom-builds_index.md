Custom builds are a way for you to customize how your code is compiled, before being processed by Wrangler.

Note

Wrangler runs [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) by default as part of the `dev` and `deploy` commands, and bundles your Worker project into a single Worker script. Refer to [Bundling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/bundling/).

## Configure custom builds

Custom builds are configured by adding a `[build]` section in your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/), and using the following options for configuring your custom build.

* `command` string optional

  * The command used to build your Worker. On Linux and macOS, the command is executed in the `sh` shell and the `cmd` shell for Windows. The `&&` and `||` shell operators may be used. This command will be run as part of `wrangler dev` and `npx wrangler deploy`.

* `cwd` string optional

  * The directory in which the command is executed.

* `watch_dir` string | string\\\[] optional

  * The directory to watch for changes while using `wrangler dev`. Defaults to the current working directory.

Example:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "build": {
      "command": "npm run build",
      "cwd": "build_cwd",
      "watch_dir": "build_watch_dir"
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [build]
  command = "npm run build"
  cwd = "build_cwd"
  watch_dir = "build_watch_dir"
  ```
