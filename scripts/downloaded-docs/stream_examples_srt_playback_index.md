Note

Before you can play live video, you must first be [actively streaming to a live input](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/stream-live/start-stream-live).

Copy the SRT Playback URL for your live input from either:

* The **Live inputs** page of the Cloudflare dashboard.

  [Go to **Live inputs**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/stream/inputs)

* The [Stream API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/stream-live/start-stream-live/#use-the-api)

Paste it into the URL below, replacing `<SRT_PLAYBACK_URL>`:

```sh
ffplay -analyzeduration 1 -fflags -nobuffer -probesize 32 -sync ext '<SRT_PLAYBACK_URL>'
```

For more, refer to [Play live video in native apps with less than one second latency](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/viewing-videos/using-own-player/#play-live-video-in-native-apps-with-less-than-1-second-latency).
