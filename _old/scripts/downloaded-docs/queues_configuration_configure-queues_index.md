Cloudflare Queues can be configured using [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), the command-line interface for Cloudflare's Developer Platform, which includes [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/), and other developer products.

Each Producer and Consumer Worker has a [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) that specifies environment variables, triggers, and resources, such as a queue. To enable Worker-to-resource communication, you must set up a [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) in your Worker project's Wrangler file.

Use the options below to configure your queue.

Note

Below are options for queues, refer to the Wrangler documentation for a full reference of the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

## Queue configuration

The following queue level settings can be configured using Wrangler:

```sh
npx wrangler queues update <QUEUE-NAME> --delivery-delay-secs 60 --message-retention-period-secs 3000
```

* `--delivery-delay-secs` number optional

  * How long a published message is delayed for, before it is delivered to consumers.
  * Must be between 0 and 43200 (12 hours).
  * Defaults to 0.

* `--message-retention-period-secs` number optional

  * How long messages are retained on the Queue.
  * Defaults to 345600 (4 days).
  * Must be between 60 and 1209600 (14 days)

## Producer Worker configuration

A producer is a [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) that writes to one or more queues. A producer can accept messages over HTTP, asynchronously write messages when handling requests, and/or write to a queue from within a [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/). Any Worker can write to a queue.

To produce to a queue, set up a binding in your Wrangler file. These options should be used when a Worker wants to send messages to a queue.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "queues": {
      "producers": [
        {
          "queue": "my-queue",
          "binding": "MY_QUEUE"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [[queues.producers]]
    queue = "my-queue"
    binding = "MY_QUEUE"
  ```

- `queue` string
  * The name of the queue.
- `binding` string
  * The name of the binding, which is a JavaScript variable.

## Consumer Worker Configuration

To consume messages from one or more queues, set up a binding in your Wrangler file. These options should be used when a Worker wants to receive messages from a queue.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "queues": {
      "consumers": [
        {
          "queue": "my-queue",
          "max_batch_size": 10,
          "max_batch_timeout": 30,
          "max_retries": 10,
          "dead_letter_queue": "my-queue-dlq"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [[queues.consumers]]
    queue = "my-queue"
    max_batch_size = 10
    max_batch_timeout = 30
    max_retries = 10
    dead_letter_queue = "my-queue-dlq"
  ```

Refer to [Limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/platform/limits) to review the maximum values for each of these options.

* `queue` string
  * The name of the queue.

* `max_batch_size` number optional

  * The maximum number of messages allowed in each batch.
  * Defaults to `10` messages.

* `max_batch_timeout` number optional

  * The maximum number of seconds to wait until a batch is full.
  * Defaults to `5` seconds.

* `max_retries` number optional

  * The maximum number of retries for a message, if it fails or [`retryAll()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/javascript-apis/#messagebatch) is invoked.
  * Defaults to `3` retries.

* `dead_letter_queue` string optional

  * The name of another queue to send a message if it fails processing at least `max_retries` times.
  * If a `dead_letter_queue` is not defined, messages that repeatedly fail processing will eventually be discarded.
  * If there is no queue with the specified name, it will be created automatically.

* `max_concurrency` number optional

  * The maximum number of concurrent consumers allowed to run at once. Leaving this unset will mean that the number of invocations will scale to the [currently supported maximum](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/platform/limits/).
  * Refer to [Consumer concurrency](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/consumer-concurrency/) for more information on how consumers autoscale, particularly when messages are retried.

## Pull-based

A queue can have a HTTP-based consumer that pulls from the queue. This consumer can be any HTTP-speaking service that can communicate over the Internet. Review [Pull consumers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/pull-consumers/) to learn how to configure a pull-based consumer.
