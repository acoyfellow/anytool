Learn how you can use Vectorize within your existing architecture.

## Reference architectures

Explore the following reference architectures that use Vectorize:

[Composable AI architecture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-composable/)

[The architecture diagram illustrates how AI applications can be built end-to-end on Cloudflare, or single services can be integrated with external infrastructure and services.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-composable/)

[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/)

[RAG combines retrieval with generative models for better text. It uses external knowledge to create factual, relevant responses, improving coherence and accuracy in NLP tasks like chatbots.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/)

[Ingesting BigQuery Data into Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/bigquery-workers-ai/)

[You can connect a Cloudflare Worker to get data from Google BigQuery and pass it to Workers AI, to run AI Models, powered by serverless GPUs.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/bigquery-workers-ai/)

[Fullstack applications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/fullstack-application/)

[A practical example of how these services come together in a real fullstack application architecture.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/fullstack-application/)
