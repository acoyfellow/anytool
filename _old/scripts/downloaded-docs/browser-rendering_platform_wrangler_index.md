[Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) is a command-line tool for building with Cloudflare developer products.

Use Wrangler to deploy projects that use the Workers Browser Rendering API.

## Install

To install Wrangler, refer to [Install and Update Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

## Bindings

[Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) allow your Workers to interact with resources on the Cloudflare developer platform. A browser binding will provide your Worker with an authenticated endpoint to interact with a dedicated Chromium browser instance.

To deploy a Browser Rendering Worker, you must declare a [browser binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) in your Worker's Wrangler configuration file.

Note

To enable built-in Node.js APIs and polyfills, add the nodejs\_compat compatibility flag to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/). This also enables nodejs\_compat\_v2 as long as your compatibility date is 2024-09-23 or later. [Learn more about the Node.js compatibility flag and v2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag).

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "browser-rendering",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "workers_dev": true,
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat_v2"
    ],
    "browser": {
      "binding": "MYBROWSER"
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # Top-level configuration
  name = "browser-rendering"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  workers_dev = true
  compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat_v2"]


  browser = { binding = "MYBROWSER" }
  ```

After the binding is declared, access the DevTools endpoint using `env.MYBROWSER` in your Worker code:

```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch(env.MYBROWSER);
```

Run `npx wrangler dev` to test your Worker locally.

Use real headless browser during local development

To interact with a real headless browser during local development, set `"remote" : true` in the Browser binding configuration. Learn more in our [remote bindings documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/development-testing/#remote-bindings).
