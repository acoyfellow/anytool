Workers Analytics Engine provides unlimited-cardinality analytics at scale, via [a built-in API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/get-started/) to write data points from Workers, and a [SQL API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-api/) to query that data.

You can use Workers Analytics Engine to:

* Expose custom analytics to your own customers
* Build usage-based billing systems
* Understand the health of your service on a per-customer or per-user basis
* Add instrumentation to frequently called code paths, without impacting performance or overwhelming external analytics systems with events
