Email Routing warns you when your DNS records are not properly configured. In Email Routing's **Overview** page, you will see a message explaining what type of problem your account's DNS records have.

Refer to Email Routing's **Settings** tab on the dashboard for more information. Email Routing will list missing DNS records or warn you about duplicate sender policy framework (SPF) records, for example.
