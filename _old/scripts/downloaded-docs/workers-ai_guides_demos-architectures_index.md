* [Multimodal AI Translator:](https://github.com/elizabethsiegle/cfworkers-ai-translate) This application uses Cloudflare Workers AI to perform multimodal translation of languages via audio and text in the browser.
* [Floor is Llava:](https://github.com/craigsdennis/floor-is-llava-workers-ai) This is an example repo to explore using the AI Vision model Llava hosted on Cloudflare Workers AI. This is a SvelteKit app hosted on Pages.
* [Workers AI Object Detector:](https://github.com/elizabethsiegle/cf-workers-ai-obj-detection-webcam) Detect objects from a webcam in a Cloudflare Worker web app with detr-resnet-50 hosted on Cloudflare using Cloudflare Workers AI.
* [Comically Bad Art Generation:](https://github.com/craigsdennis/comically-bad-art-workers-ai-streamlit) This app uses the wonderful Python UI Framework Streamlit and Cloudflare Workers AI.
* [Whatever-ify:](https://github.com/craigsdennis/whatever-ify-workers-ai) Turn yourself into...whatever. Take a photo, get a description, generate a scene and character, then generate an image based on that calendar.
* [Phoney AI:](https://github.com/craigsdennis/phoney-ai) This application uses Cloudflare Workers AI, Twilio, and AssemblyAI. Your phone is an input and output device.
* [Image Model Streamlit starters:](https://github.com/craigsdennis/image-model-streamlit-workers-ai) Collection of Streamlit applications that are making use of Cloudflare Workers AI.
* [Vanilla JavaScript Chat Application using Cloudflare Workers AI:](https://github.com/craigsdennis/vanilla-chat-workers-ai) A web based chat interface built on Cloudflare Pages that allows for exploring Text Generation models on Cloudflare Workers AI. Design is built using tailwind.

## Reference architectures

Explore the following reference architectures that use Workers AI:

[Content-based asset creation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-asset-creation/)

[AI systems combine text-generation and text-to-image models to create visual content from text. They generate prompts, moderate content, and produce images for various applications.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-asset-creation/)

[Composable AI architecture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-composable/)

[The architecture diagram illustrates how AI applications can be built end-to-end on Cloudflare, or single services can be integrated with external infrastructure and services.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-composable/)

[Multi-vendor AI observability and control](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-multivendor-observability-control/)

[By shifting features such as rate limiting, caching, and error handling to the proxy layer, organizations can apply unified configurations across services and inference service providers.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-multivendor-observability-control/)

[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/)

[RAG combines retrieval with generative models for better text. It uses external knowledge to create factual, relevant responses, improving coherence and accuracy in NLP tasks like chatbots.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/)

[Automatic captioning for video uploads](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-video-caption/)

[By integrating automatic speech recognition technology into video platforms, content creators, publishers, and distributors can reach a broader audience, including individuals with hearing impairments or those who prefer to consume content in different languages.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-video-caption/)

[Ingesting BigQuery Data into Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/bigquery-workers-ai/)

[You can connect a Cloudflare Worker to get data from Google BigQuery and pass it to Workers AI, to run AI Models, powered by serverless GPUs.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/bigquery-workers-ai/)
