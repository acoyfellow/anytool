Learn how you can use Queues within your existing application and architecture.

## Demos

Explore the following demo applications for Queues.

* [Jobs At Conf:](https://github.com/harshil1712/jobs-at-conf-demo) A job lisiting website to add jobs you find at in-person conferences. Built with Cloudflare Pages, R2, D1, Queues, and Workers AI.
* [Wildebeest:](https://github.com/cloudflare/wildebeest) Wildebeest is an ActivityPub and Mastodon-compatible server whose goal is to allow anyone to operate their Fediverse server and identity on their domain without needing to keep infrastructure, with minimal setup and maintenance, and running in minutes.
* [Queues Web Crawler:](https://github.com/cloudflare/queues-web-crawler) An example use-case for Queues, a web crawler built on Browser Rendering and Puppeteer. The crawler finds the number of links to Cloudflare.com on the site, and archives a screenshot to Workers KV.

## Reference architectures

Explore the following reference architectures that use Queues:

[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/)

[RAG combines retrieval with generative models for better text. It uses external knowledge to create factual, relevant responses, improving coherence and accuracy in NLP tasks like chatbots.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/)

[Fullstack applications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/fullstack-application/)

[A practical example of how these services come together in a real fullstack application architecture.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/fullstack-application/)

[Serverless ETL pipelines](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/serverless-etl/)

[Cloudflare enables fully serverless ETL pipelines, significantly reducing complexity, accelerating time to production, and lowering overall costs.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/serverless-etl/)
