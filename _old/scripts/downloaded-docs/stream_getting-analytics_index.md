Stream provides server-side analytics that can be used to:

* Identify most viewed video content in your app or platform.
* Identify where content is viewed from and when it is viewed.
* Understand which creators on your platform are publishing the most viewed content, and analyze trends.

You can access data on either:

* The Stream **Analytics** page of the Cloudflare dashboard.

  [Go to **Analytics**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/stream/analytics)

* The [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/getting-analytics/fetching-bulk-analytics).

Users will need the **Analytics** permission to access analytics via Dash or GraphQL.
