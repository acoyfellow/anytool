**Updates to Playwright, new support for Stagehand, and increased limits**

* [Playwright](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/platform/playwright/) support in Browser Rendering is now GA. We've upgraded to [Playwright v1.55](https://playwright.dev/docs/release-notes#version-155).
* Added support for [Stagehand](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/platform/stagehand/), an open source browser automation framework, powered by [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai). Stagehand enables developers to build more reliably and flexibly by combining code with natural-language instructions.
* Increased [limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/platform/limits/#workers-paid) for paid plans on both the [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/) and [Workers Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/).
