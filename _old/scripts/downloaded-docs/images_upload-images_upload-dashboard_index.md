Before you upload an image, check the list of [supported formats and dimensions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/upload-images/#supported-image-formats) to confirm your image will be accepted.

To upload an image from the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Images** page.

   [Go to **Overview**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/images)

2. Drag and drop your image into the **Quick Upload** section. Alternatively, you can select **Drop images here** or browse to select your image locally.

3. After the upload finishes, your image appears in the list of files.
