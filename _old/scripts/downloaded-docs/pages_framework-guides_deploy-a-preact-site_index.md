[Preact](https://preactjs.com) is a popular, open-source framework for building modern web applications. Preact can also be used as a lightweight alternative to React because the two share the same API and component model.

In this guide, you will create a new Preact application and deploy it using Cloudflare Pages. You will use [`create-preact`](https://github.com/preactjs/create-preact), a lightweight project scaffolding tool to set up a new Preact app in seconds.

## Setting up a new project

Create a new project by running the [`npm init`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-init) command in your terminal, giving it a title:

```sh
npm init preact
cd your-project-name
```

Note

During initialization, you can accept the `Prerender app (SSG)?` option to have `create-preact` scaffold your app to produce static HTML pages, along with their assets, for production builds. This option is perfect for Pages.

## Before you continue

All of the framework guides assume you already have a fundamental understanding of [Git](https://git-scm.com/). If you are new to Git, refer to this [summarized Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) on how to set up Git on your local machine.

If you clone with SSH, you must [generate SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub.

Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) and [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for more information.

## Create a GitHub repository

Create a new GitHub repository by visiting [repo.new](https://repo.new). After creating a new repository, go to your newly created project directory to prepare and push your local application to GitHub by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-gh-username>/<repository-name>
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

To deploy your site to Pages:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.

   [Go to **Workers & Pages**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)

2. Select **Create application**.

3. Select the **Pages** tab.

4. Select **Import an existing Git repository**.

5. Select the new GitHub repository that you created and then select **Begin setup**.

6. In the **Set up builds and deployments** section, provide the following information:

| Configuration option | Value |
| - | - |
| Production branch | `main` |
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Build directory | `dist` |

Optionally, you can customize the **Project name** field. It defaults to the GitHub repository's name, but it does not need to match. The **Project name** value is assigned as your `*.pages.dev` subdomain.

After completing configuration, select **Save and Deploy**.

You will see your first deploy pipeline in progress. Pages installs all dependencies and builds the project as specified.

After you have deployed your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`.

Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it on every new pushed commit.

Additionally, you will have access to [preview deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/), which repeat the build-and-deploy process for pull requests. With these, you can preview changes to your project with a real URL before deploying them to production.

Note

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/).
