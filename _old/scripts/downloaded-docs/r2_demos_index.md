Learn how you can use R2 within your existing application and architecture.

## Demos

Explore the following demo applications for R2.

* [Jobs At Conf:](https://github.com/harshil1712/jobs-at-conf-demo) A job lisiting website to add jobs you find at in-person conferences. Built with Cloudflare Pages, R2, D1, Queues, and Workers AI.
* [Upload Image to R2 starter:](https://github.com/harshil1712/nextjs-r2-demo) Upload images to Cloudflare R2 from a Next.js application.
* [DMARC Email Worker:](https://github.com/cloudflare/dmarc-email-worker) A Cloudflare worker script to process incoming DMARC reports, store them, and produce analytics.

## Reference architectures

Explore the following reference architectures that use R2:

[Composable AI architecture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-composable/)
