Warning

This documentation describes the Miniflare API, which is only relevant for advanced use cases. Instead, most users should use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler) to build, run & deploy their Workers locally

**Miniflare** is a simulator for developing and testing [**Cloudflare Workers**](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). It's written in TypeScript, and runs your code in a sandbox implementing Workers' runtime APIs.

* ðŸŽ‰ **Fun:** develop Workers easily with detailed logging, file watching and pretty error pages supporting source maps.
* ðŸ”‹ **Full-featured:** supports most Workers features, including KV, Durable Objects, WebSockets, modules and more.
* âš¡ **Fully-local:** test and develop Workers without an Internet connection. Reload code on change quickly.
