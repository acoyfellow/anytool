You can delete objects from your bucket from the Cloudflare dashboard or using the Wrangler.

## Delete objects via the Cloudflare dashboard

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **R2 object storage** page.

   [Go to **Overview**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/overview)

2. Locate and select your bucket.

3. Locate the object you want to delete. You can select multiple objects to delete at one time.

4. Select your objects and select **Delete**.

5. Confirm your choice by selecting **Delete**.

## Delete objects via Wrangler

Warning

Deleting objects from a bucket is irreversible.

You can delete an object directly by calling `delete` against a `{bucket}/{path/to/object}`.

For example, to delete the object `foo.png` from bucket `test-bucket`:

```sh
wrangler r2 object delete test-bucket/foo.png
```

```sh
Deleting object "foo.png" from bucket "test-bucket".
Delete complete.
```
