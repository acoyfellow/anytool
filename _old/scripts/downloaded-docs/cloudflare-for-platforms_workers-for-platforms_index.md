Workers for Platforms allows you to run your own code as a wrapper around your user's code. With Workers for Platforms, you can logically group your code separately from your users' code, create custom logic, and use additional APIs such as [script tags](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/tags/) for bulk operations.

Workers for Platforms is built on top of [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/). Workers for Platforms lets you surpass Cloudflare Workers' 500 scripts per account [limit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/platform/limits/).
