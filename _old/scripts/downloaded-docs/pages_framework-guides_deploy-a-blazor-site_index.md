[Blazor](https://blazor.net) is an SPA framework that can use C# code, rather than JavaScript in the browser. In this guide, you will build a site using Blazor, and deploy it using Cloudflare Pages.

## Install .NET

Blazor uses C#. You will need the latest version of the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) to continue creating a Blazor project. If you don't have the SDK installed on your system please download and run the installer.

## Creating a new Blazor WASM project

There are two types of Blazor hosting models: [Blazor Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-8.0#blazor-server) which requires a server to serve the Blazor application to the end user, and [Blazor WebAssembly](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-8.0#blazor-webassembly) which runs in the browser. Blazor Server is incompatible with the Cloudflare edge network model, thus this guide only use Blazor WebAssembly.

Create a new Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) application by running the following command:

```sh
dotnet new blazorwasm -o my-blazor-project
```

## Create the build script

To deploy, Cloudflare Pages will need a way to build the Blazor project. In the project's directory root, create a `build.sh` file. Populate the file with this (updating the `.dotnet-install.sh` line appropriately if you're not using the latest .NET SDK):

```plaintext
#!/bin/sh
curl -sSL https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh > dotnet-install.sh
chmod +x dotnet-install.sh
./dotnet-install.sh -c 8.0 -InstallDir ./dotnet
./dotnet/dotnet --version
./dotnet/dotnet publish -c Release -o output
```

Your `build.sh` file needs to be executable for the build command to work. You can make it so by running `chmod +x build.sh`.

## Before you continue

All of the framework guides assume you already have a fundamental understanding of [Git](https://git-scm.com/). If you are new to Git, refer to this [summarized Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) on how to set up Git on your local machine.

If you clone with SSH, you must [generate SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub.

Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) and [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for more information.

## Create a `.gitignore` file

Creating a `.gitignore` file ensures that only what is needed gets pushed onto your GitHub repository. Create a `.gitignore` file by running the following command:

```sh
dotnet new gitignore
```

## Create a GitHub repository

Create a new GitHub repository by visiting [repo.new](https://repo.new). After creating a new repository, go to your newly created project directory to prepare and push your local application to GitHub by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-gh-username>/<repository-name>
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

To deploy your site to Pages:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.

   [Go to **Workers & Pages**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)

2. Select **Create application**.

3. Select the **Pages** tab.

4. Select **Import an existing Git repository**.

5. Select the new GitHub repository that you created and then select **Begin setup**.

6. In the **Set up builds and deployments** section, provide the following information:

| Configuration option | Value |
| - | - |
| Production branch | `main` |
| Build command | `./build.sh` |
| Build directory | `output/wwwroot` |

After configuring your site, you can begin your first deploy. You should see Cloudflare Pages installing `dotnet`, your project dependencies, and building your site, before deploying it.

Note

For the complete guide to deploying your first site to Cloudflare Pages, refer to the [Get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/).

After deploying your site, you will receive a unique subdomain for your project on `*.pages.dev`. Every time you commit new code to your Blazor site, Cloudflare Pages will automatically rebuild your project and deploy it. You will also get access to [preview deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/preview-deployments/) on new pull requests, so you can preview how changes look to your site before deploying them to production.

## Troubleshooting

### A file is over the 25 MiB limit

If you receive the error message `Error: Asset "/opt/buildhome/repo/output/wwwroot/_framework/dotnet.wasm" is over the 25MiB limit`, resolve this by doing one of the following actions:

1. Reduce the size of your assets with the following [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/performance?view=aspnetcore-6.0#minimize-app-download-size).

Or

1. Remove the `*.wasm` files from the output (`rm output/wwwroot/_framework/*.wasm`) and modify your Blazor application to [load the Brotli compressed files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly?view=aspnetcore-6.0#compression) instead.

By completing this guide, you have successfully deployed your Blazor site to Cloudflare Pages. To get started with other frameworks, [refer to the list of Framework guides](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/).
