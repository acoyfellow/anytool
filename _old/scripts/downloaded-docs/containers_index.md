Enhance your Workers with serverless containers

Available on Workers Paid plan

Run code written in any programming language, built for any runtime, as part of apps built on [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers).

Deploy your container image to Region:Earth without worrying about managing infrastructure - just define your Worker and `wrangler deploy`.

With Containers you can run:

* Resource-intensive applications that require CPU cores running in parallel, large amounts of memory or disk space
* Applications and libraries that require a full filesystem, specific runtime, or Linux-like environment
* Existing applications and tools that have been distributed as container images

Container instances are spun up on-demand and controlled by code you write in your [Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers). Instead of chaining together API calls or writing Kubernetes operators, you just write JavaScript:

* Worker Code

  ```js
  import { Container, getContainer } from "@cloudflare/containers";


  export class MyContainer extends Container {
    defaultPort = 4000; // Port the container is listening on
    sleepAfter = "10m"; // Stop the instance if requests not sent for 10 minutes
  }


  export default {
    async fetch(request, env) {
      const { "session-id": sessionId } = await request.json();
      // Get the container instance for the given session ID
      const containerInstance = getContainer(env.MY_CONTAINER, sessionId);
      // Pass the request to the container instance on its default port
      return containerInstance.fetch(request);
    },
  };
  ```

* Worker Config

  * wrangler.jsonc

    ```jsonc
    {
      "name": "container-starter",
      "main": "src/index.js",
      "compatibility_date": "2025-10-03",
      "containers": [
        {

        }
      ]
    }
    ```
