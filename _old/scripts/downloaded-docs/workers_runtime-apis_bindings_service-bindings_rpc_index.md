[Service bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings) allow one Worker to call into another, without going through a publicly-accessible URL.

You can use Service bindings to create your own internal APIs that your Worker makes available to other Workers. This can be done by extending the built-in `WorkerEntrypoint` class, and adding your own public methods. These public methods can then be directly called by other Workers on your Cloudflare account that declare a [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings) to this Worker.

The [RPC system in Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc) is designed feel as similar as possible to calling a JavaScript function in the same Worker. In most cases, you should be able to write code in the same way you would if everything was in a single Worker.

Note

You can also use RPC to communicate between Workers and [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/best-practices/create-durable-object-stubs-and-send-requests/#invoke-rpc-methods).

## Example

For example, the following Worker implements the public method `add(a, b)`:

For example, if Worker B implements the public method `add(a, b)`:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "worker_b",
    "main": "./src/workerB.js"
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "worker_b"
  main = "./src/workerB.js"
  ```

- JavaScript

  ```js
  import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";


  export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
    async fetch() {
      return new Response("Hello from Worker B");
    }


    add(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }
  }
  ```

- TypeScript

  ```ts
  import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";


  export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
    async fetch() {
      return new Response("Hello from Worker B");
    }


    add(a: number, b: number) {
      return a + b;
    }
  }
  ```

- Python

  ```python
  from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response


  class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
      async def fetch(self, request):
          return Response("Hello from Worker B")


      def add(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
          return a + b
  ```

Worker A can declare a [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings) to Worker B:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "worker_a",
    "main": "./src/workerA.js",
    "services": [
      {
        "binding": "WORKER_B",
        "service": "worker_b"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "worker_a"
  main = "./src/workerA.js"
  services = [
    { binding = "WORKER_B", service = "worker_b" }
  ]
  ```

Making it possible for Worker A to call the `add()` method from Worker B:

* JavaScript

  ```js
  export default {
    async fetch(request, env) {
      const result = await env.WORKER_B.add(1, 2);
      return new Response(result);
    },
  };
  ```

* TypeScript

  ```ts
  export default {
    async fetch(request, env) {
      const result = await env.WORKER_B.add(1, 2);
      return new Response(result);
    },
  };
  ```

* Python

  ```python
  from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response


  class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
      async def fetch(self, request):
          result = await self.env.WORKER_B.add(1, 2)
      return Response(f"Result: {result}")
  ```

You do not need to learn, implement, or think about special protocols to use the RPC system. The client, in this case Worker A, calls Worker B and tells it to execute a specific procedure using specific arguments that the client provides. This is accomplished with standard JavaScript classes.

## The `WorkerEntrypoint` Class

To provide RPC methods from your Worker, you must extend the `WorkerEntrypoint` class, as shown in the example below:

```js
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";


export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  async add(a, b) { return a + b; }
}
```

A new instance of the class is created every time the Worker is called. Note that even though the Worker is implemented as a class, it is still stateless — the class instance only lasts for the duration of the invocation. If you need to persist or coordinate state in Workers, you should use [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects).

### Bindings (`env`)

The [`env`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings) object is exposed as a class property of the `WorkerEntrypoint` class.

For example, a Worker that declares a binding to the [environment variable](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) `GREETING`:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "my-worker",
    "vars": {
      "GREETING": "Hello"
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "my-worker"


  [vars]
  GREETING = "Hello"
  ```

Can access it by calling `this.env.GREETING`:

```js
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";


export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  fetch() { return new Response("Hello from my-worker"); }


  async greet(name) {
    return this.env.GREETING + name;
  }
}
```

You can use any type of [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings) this way.

### Lifecycle methods (`ctx`)

The [`ctx`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context) object is exposed as a class property of the `WorkerEntrypoint` class.

For example, you can extend the lifetime of the invocation context by calling the `waitUntil()` method:

```js
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";


export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  fetch() { return new Response("Hello from my-worker"); }


  async signup(email, name) {
    // sendEvent() will continue running, even after this method returns a value to the caller
    this.ctx.waitUntil(this.#sendEvent("signup", email))
    // Perform any other work
    return "Success";
  }


  async #sendEvent(eventName, email) {
    //...
  }
}
```

## Named entrypoints

You can also export any number of named `WorkerEntrypoint` classes from within a single Worker, in addition to the default export. You can then declare a Service binding to a specific named entrypoint.

You can use this to group multiple pieces of compute together. For example, you might create a distinct `WorkerEntrypoint` for each permission role in your application, and use these to provide role-specific RPC methods:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "todo-app",
    "d1_databases": [
      {
        "binding": "D1",
        "database_name": "todo-app-db",
        "database_id": "<unique-ID-for-your-database>"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "todo-app"


  [[d1_databases]]
  binding = "D1"
  database_name = "todo-app-db"
  database_id = "<unique-ID-for-your-database>"
  ```

```js
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";


export class AdminEntrypoint extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  async createUser(username) {
    await this.env.D1.prepare("INSERT INTO users (username) VALUES (?)")
      .bind(username)
      .run();
  }


  async deleteUser(username) {
    await this.env.D1.prepare("DELETE FROM users WHERE username = ?")
      .bind(username)
      .run();
  }
}


export class UserEntrypoint extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  async getTasks(userId) {
    return await this.env.D1.prepare(
      "SELECT title FROM tasks WHERE user_id = ?"
    )
      .bind(userId)
      .run();
  }


  async createTask(userId, title) {
    await this.env.D1.prepare(
      "INSERT INTO tasks (user_id, title) VALUES (?, ?)"
    )
      .bind(userId, title)
      .run();
  }
}


export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    return new Response("Hello from my to do app");
  }
}
```

You can then declare a Service binding directly to `AdminEntrypoint` in another Worker:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "admin-app",
    "services": [
      {
        "binding": "ADMIN",
        "service": "todo-app",
        "entrypoint": "AdminEntrypoint"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "admin-app"


  [[services]]
  binding = "ADMIN"
  service = "todo-app"
  entrypoint = "AdminEntrypoint"
  ```

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    await env.ADMIN.createUser("aNewUser");
    return new Response("Hello from admin app");
  },
};
```

You can learn more about how to configure D1 in the [D1 documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/get-started/#3-bind-your-worker-to-your-d1-database).

You can try out a complete example of this to do app, as well as a Discord bot built with named entrypoints, by cloning the [cloudflare/js-rpc-and-entrypoints-demo repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/js-rpc-and-entrypoints-demo) from GitHub.
