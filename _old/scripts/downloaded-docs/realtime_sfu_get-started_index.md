Before you get started:

You must first [create a Cloudflare account](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/create-account/).

## Create your first app

Every Realtime App is a separate environment, so you can make one for development, staging and production versions for your product. Either using [Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/calls), or the [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/calls/subresources/sfu/methods/create/) create a Realtime App. When you create a Realtime App, you will get:

* App ID
* App Secret

These two combined will allow you to make API Realtime from your backend server to Realtime.
