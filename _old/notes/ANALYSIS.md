# AnyTool Analysis: One Tool to Rule Them All

## The Vision
Use Cloudflare Worker Loaders to create a single tool that can dynamically generate and execute arbitrary code safely in isolated Workers. Each generated tool runs in its own sandbox with full CF Workers capabilities.

## What We've Tried

### Approach 1: Svelte REPL Style (src4/src5)
- **Concept**: Transform npm imports to CDN URLs, let browser/Worker resolve modules
- **Status**: ❌ **FAILED** - Worker Loader can't resolve external CDN imports
- **Issue**: `https://esm.sh/uuid` becomes `https:/esm.sh/uuid` (missing slash) or dependencies have their own imports

### Approach 2: Container Bundling (src3)
- **Concept**: Use CF Containers with bun to `bun install` + bundle packages
- **Status**: ❌ **FAILED** - CF network restrictions block `bun install`
- **Issue**: "FailedToOpenSocket downloading package manifest" errors

## Root Problems

1. **Network Isolation**: CF production environment blocks outbound connections needed for package installation
2. **Module Resolution**: Worker Loader expects self-contained modules, not external imports
3. **Dependency Graphs**: Even "bundled" CDN modules often import other modules

## The Real Solution Architecture

The key insight: **Pre-fetch and bundle everything BEFORE sending to Worker Loader**

```
LLM → Generate Code → Dependency Resolution → Pre-bundle → Worker Loader → Execute
```
